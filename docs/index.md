## What is Celluler?

Celluler is a decentralized microservices platform built on peer-to-peer protocols, where each service (called a "cell") is both a self-contained unit and part of a larger network. Cells communicate through a secure messaging protocol and maintain their state through distributed append-only logs (Hypercore) and consensus (Hashgraph).

## Core Features

- **P2P Microservices**: Build and deploy decentralized services that communicate directly
- **Built-in Identity**: Cryptographic identity verification through social interaction history
- **Consensus**: Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus for global state
- **Data Integrity**: Tamper-evident logs for all service state
- **Service Architecture**: Modular, scalable service design using Moleculer
