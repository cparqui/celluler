## What is Celluler?

Celluler is a decentralized AI agent ecosystem built on peer-to-peer protocols, where nodes (called "cells") collaborate to run AI models, host datasets, and provide training feedback in a distributed manner.

## Core Features

- **Distributed AI**: Run AI models across a network of cells
- **P2P Networking**: Secure and efficient cell-to-cell communication
- **Consensus**: Maintain global state through distributed consensus
- **Data Distribution**: Share and version data across the network
- **Service Architecture**: Modular, scalable service design
