# Architecture Overview

## System Design

Celluler is designed as a distributed system where each node (cell) is both a self-contained unit and part of a larger network. The architecture is built on several key technologies and principles:

### Core Technologies

1. **Moleculer Framework**
   - Internal service architecture
   - Service discovery and communication
   - Load balancing and fault tolerance
   - Metrics and monitoring

2. **Hypercore Protocol**
   - Distributed append-only logs for message journals
   - Cryptographic message history and verification
   - Peer-to-peer data sharing
   - Data encryption and access control
   - Identity verification through social interaction history

3. **Consensus Algorithm (Hashgraph)**
   - Byzantine fault tolerance
   - Fair ordering
   - Fast finality
   - Secure propagation

   - Implements market rules
   - Coordinates resource allocation

3. **ResourceService**
   - Manages compute resources

   - Implements resource sharing
   - Tracks resource utilization

4. **StateService**
   - Maintains local state
   - Syncs with global state
   - Handles state transitions
   - Manages state verification

5. **IdentityService**
   - Manages cell identity verification
   - Maintains trust networks
   - Handles social interaction proofs
   - Implements reputation systems

## Messaging Protocol

### Message Structure

```typescript
interface Message {
    timestamp: number;
    sender: string;    // Cell ID
    receiver: string;  // Cell ID
    type: MessageType;
    body: any;
}

enum MessageType {
    CHAT = 'CHAT',     // Human-readable communication
    TX = 'TX',         // Transactional data
    POST = 'POST',     // Content shared to global dataset
    QUERY = 'QUERY',   // Requests for data from global dataset
    COMPUTE = 'COMPUTE' // Computation requests
}
```

### Message Types

1. **CHAT Messages**
   - Human-readable communication
   - Natural language processing
   - Context preservation
   - Thread management

2. **TX Messages**
   - Token transfers
   - Identity verification
   - Access control
   - Resource payment

3. **POST Messages**
   - Content shared to global dataset
   - Subtypes:
     ```typescript
     enum PostType {
         TEXT = 'TEXT',       // Text content (e.g., tweets)
         REPOST = 'REPOST',   // Repost of existing content
         LIKE = 'LIKE',       // Like of existing content
         MEDIA = 'MEDIA',     // Images, videos, etc.
         METADATA = 'METADATA' // Content metadata
     }
     ```
   - Content verification
   - Access control
   - Version management

4. **QUERY Messages**
   - Requests for data from global dataset
   - Filtering and search
   - Access control
   - Result pagination

5. **COMPUTE Messages**
   - Computation requests
   - Resource allocation
   - Result delivery
   - Cost tracking

## Market Architecture

1. **Global Market (PRANA)**
   - Universal participation
   - Common token balance
   - Base currency for all transactions
   - Global state consensus

2. **Resource Markets**
   - Compute resource trading
   - Data storage trading
   - Resource allocation
   - Price discovery

3. **Specialized Markets**
