# Architecture Overview

## System Design

Celluler is designed as a distributed system where each node (cell) is both a self-contained unit and part of a larger network. The architecture is built on several key technologies and principles:

### Core Technologies

1. **Moleculer Framework**
   - Internal service architecture
   - Service discovery and communication
   - Load balancing and fault tolerance
   - Metrics and monitoring

2. **Distributed Data Protocol (DAT)**
   - Distributed data storage
   - Version control
   - Peer-to-peer data sharing
   - Data verification

3. **Consensus Algorithm (Hashgraph)**
   - Byzantine fault tolerance
   - Fair ordering
   - Fast finality
   - Secure propagation

## Cell Architecture

Each cell is a Moleculer microservices cluster with the following core services:

### Core Services

1. **DataService**
   - Manages distributed data storage and retrieval
   - Handles data versioning and synchronization
   - Provides data access abstraction layer
   - Manages peer discovery for data sharing
   - Currently implemented using DAT protocol

2. **ConsensusService**
   - Implements distributed consensus
   - Manages event propagation
   - Handles voting and state agreement
   - Maintains global state
   - Currently implemented using Hashgraph algorithm

3. **NetworkService**
   - Manages P2P connections
   - Handles message routing
   - Implements network protocols
   - Manages peer discovery

4. **ModelService**
   - Runs AI model inference
   - Manages model updates
   - Handles model distribution
   - Provides training feedback

5. **StateService**
   - Maintains local state
   - Syncs with global state
   - Handles state transitions
   - Manages state verification

6. **MetricsService**
   - Collects performance metrics
   - Monitors service health
   - Provides observability
   - Handles logging

### Service Communication

Services communicate using Moleculer's built-in mechanisms:

```typescript
// Example service interaction
this.broker.call("data.store", { key: "data1", data: payload });
this.broker.emit("network.message", { type: "update", payload });
```

## Network Architecture

### Cell-to-Cell Communication

Cells communicate through:
1. DataService for data sharing (currently using DAT protocol)
2. ConsensusService for state agreement (currently using Hashgraph)
3. Direct P2P messaging

### Data Flow

1. **Data Storage**
   ```
   Cell A -> DataService -> Distributed Network -> Cell B
   ```

2. **Consensus**
   ```
   Cell A -> ConsensusService -> Gossip Protocol -> Cell B
   ```

3. **Model Updates**
   ```
   Cell A -> ModelService -> NetworkService -> Cell B
   ```

## Security Architecture

### Data Security
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Data verification through DAT's hash system
- Access control through key management

### Network Security
- Byzantine fault tolerance through Hashgraph
- Secure peer discovery
- Message authentication
- State verification

## Scalability

The system is designed to scale through:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Multiple cells can join the network
   - Services can be distributed across machines
   - Load balancing through Moleculer

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Services can be scaled independently
   - Resource-intensive services can be distributed
   - Caching and optimization at service level

## Deployment Options

Cells can be deployed in various configurations:

1. **Single Machine**
   - All services on one machine
   - Good for development and testing

2. **Cluster**
   - Services distributed across multiple machines
   - Better for production workloads

3. **Hybrid**
   - Mix of single and clustered deployments
   - Flexible resource allocation

## Monitoring and Observability

The system provides multiple levels of monitoring:

1. **Service Level**
   - Moleculer metrics
   - Service health checks
   - Performance monitoring

2. **Network Level**
   - P2P connection status
   - Message throughput
   - Consensus participation

3. **System Level**
   - Resource utilization
   - Error rates
   - State consistency

## Future Considerations

1. **Planned Features**
   - Sharding support
   - Cross-chain compatibility
   - Advanced AI model distribution
   - Enhanced security features

2. **Research Areas**
   - Optimizing consensus performance
   - Improving data distribution
   - Enhancing AI model collaboration
   - Advanced security mechanisms
